I recently read about "Life in Weeks" in the book Tiny Experiments. 

It's supposed to be a visual representation (tiny squares arranged in a grid) to show how many weeks you've lived since birth and how long you've got left. The colored squares represent your life up until now, while the blank ones indicate the future weeks to come.

I found it really interesting and thought I could use it to foster a healthy sense of urgency in my life.

So I coded a script to automate an email each week sending me an updated image of my life in weeks (thanks ChatGPT!). 
As the days go by, it will serve as a reminder of how limited my time is on earth - and hopefully propel me to act on the important things.


My life in weeks - as I write this, I'm at my 1242th week.
